= Link Prediction with Neo4j's Graph Data Science Library

This repository contains both Jupyter notebooks for solving a link prediction problem using Neo4j's Graph Data Science Library and scikit-learn.

The associated developer guide for this repository can be found at https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-data-science/link-prediction/scikit-learn/[neo4j.com/developer/graph-data-science/link-prediction/scikit-learn/^]

== Running the examples

You can run the examples by following the instructions below:

=== Download code from GitHub

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-examples/link-prediction.git
cd link-prediction
----

=== Launch Neo4j and Jupyter Notebooks

You can launch the notebooks and Neo4j by using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

This will spin up a Neo4j server and Jupyter session.
The terminal output will look a bit like this:
